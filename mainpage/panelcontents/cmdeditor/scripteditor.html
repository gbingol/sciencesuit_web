        Maybe you need more than few lines of commands to solve a problem. 
        There is a <em>script editor that is within the command editor</em> to keep you focused on the task.

    Say, you have started typing a command at the command prompt and realized that you would like to switch to the scripting
    mode. Just press <b>Shift+Enter</b> or <b>Ctrl+Enter</b>.
    </p>

        Needless to say but you can browse the history of the scripts and save all your scripts as well.
